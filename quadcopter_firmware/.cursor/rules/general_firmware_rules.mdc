- Any time you make changes to the C++ firmware project, before you finish,
  please make sure to verify your change did not break the build by running this
  command:

```
idf.py build
```

- Right now, the C++ firmware is not super well tested, but I do have some basic
  tests on the MedianFilter type. If you make changes to the MedianFilter please
  run these tests, and add any new tests to it as necessary:

```
cd test/build
cmake --build .
ctest
```

- Verify that 100% of the tests pass. If they do not then something is broken.
